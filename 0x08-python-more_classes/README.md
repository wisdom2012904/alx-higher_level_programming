0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

Resources

Read or watch:

    1. Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded)): https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html 
    2. Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”): https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php
    3. Class and Instance Attributes: https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php
    4. classmethods and staticmethods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M
    5. Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”): https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php
    6. str vs repr: https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html



Lesson learnt:
I have learnt a number of key concepts which are crucial to python programming. Some of these include:

    1. Why Python programming is awesome
    What is OOP
    “first-class everything”
    2. What is a class
    3. What is an object and an instance
    4. What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    5. What is an attribute
    6. What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
    7. What is self
    8. What is a method
    9. What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
    10.What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
    11.What is a property
    12.What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
    13.What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
    14.What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
    15.What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
    16.What is a class attribute
    17.What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
    18.What is a class method
    19.What is a static method
    20.How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
    21.How to bind attributes to object and classes
    22.What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
    23.How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
    24How to use the getattr function
